After you select the Station Wallet extension for the first time, you will be presented with important tips for recovering an existing wallet. If your intention is to recover an existing wallet, please carefully read and follow those tips to insure that you do so properly. For this tutorial, we will be creating a new wallet. To create a new Station Wallet, click Confirm to close the recovery tips, and then select "New wallet" from the available options.  

### Step 4: Write down your Seed Phrase

After selecting "New wallet" you will be redirected to a Station Wallet page where you will be prompted to securely write down your mnemonic seed phrase. Write the 24-word seed phrase down in a secure and private place and in the proper order. Please double-check your spelling to ensure that you have saved it properly.

Losing the seed phrase will lead to loss of the funds kept in the wallet. Do not share your seed phrase with anyone.

Once you've written down your seed phrase, you will also need to create a name and password for your new wallet. Note your password down in a safe place as this will be required to log in to your wallet interface. If you lose your password, you can retrieve your wallet by recovering from your seed phrase and creating a new wallet name/password.

Once complete, click on "Submit".

### Step 5: Verify the seed phrase

Verify the seed phrase by inserting the correct phrase in the right order. Once complete, click on "Complete".

### Step 6: Congrats! You've created a Station Wallet

Your new wallet has now been created and is ready to go!

# Swapper

[`mars-swapper-base`](./base) contains chain-agnostic logics for the swapper contract. Each chain specific implementation should implement its own route struct that should implement the `mars_swapper_base::Route` trait and then use the `mars_swapper_base::SwapBase` to implement the entry point functions. See [`mars-swapper-osmosis`](./osmosis) for an example. Each chain specific swapper will thus implement the same API.

<Admonition type="info" title="NOTE">
The swapper contracts should NEVER hold any funds and any funds sent to the contract except as part of executing the SwapExactIn message can be stolen by an attacker.

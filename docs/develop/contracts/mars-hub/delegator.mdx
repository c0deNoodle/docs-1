# delegator

The purpose of this contract is **to bootstrap the security of Mars Hub blockchain.**

At launch, Mars Hub will have a genesis validator set of 10–20 members, each having exactly 1 MARS token. The decision was made that each genesis validator only gets 1 token and not more, such that they don't have an unfair advantage over those who join post-genesis. However, this also means that for a brief period after launch, the network will have a very low security (10–20 MARS worth of security, to be specific). If a user is eligible for a big airdrop, they can potentially create a validator with the airdrop tokens right after launch and hijack the network.

To mitigate this risk, the Mars community pool will have a portion of its tokens (~1% of total supply may be a reasonable amount) deposited into this "delegator" contract, which then delegates the tokens evenly to each of the genesis validators. At instantiation, the contract will be given an `ending_time` for these delegations. Once the ending time is elapsed, anyone can invoke a method on the contract to unbond these delegations. Once unbonding is completed, anyone can invoke `refund` to return all funds to the community pool.

## InstantiateMsg

Instantiates the Delegator contract.

<CH.Section>
<CH.Code>

```json json
{
    "bond_denom": "...",
    "ending_time": 123
}
```

```rust msg.rs
pub type InstantiateMsg = Config;

#[cw_serde]
pub struct Config {
    pub bond_denom: String,
    pub ending_time: u64,
}
```

</CH.Code>

| **Params**      | **Type** | **Description** |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| [`bond_denom`](focus://json#2)   | `String`       | Denomination of the coin that will be staked        |
| [`ending_time`](focus://json#3)   | `u64`       | The ending time for the delegation program, as UNIX timestamp. Once this time has elapsed, anyone can invoke the `unbond` method to unbond the delegations. Additionally, Mars Hub governance can decide to prematurely end the delegation program if they see fit, ignoring the ending time, by invoking the `force_unbond` sudo message.        |

## ExecuteMsg

### `bond`

Delegate tokens that the contract holds evenly to the current validator set.

<CH.Section>
<CH.Code>

```json json
{
    "bond": {}
}
```

```rust msg.rs focus=1:3,6
#[cw_serde]
pub enum ExecuteMsg {
    Bond {},
    Unbond {},
    Refund {},
}
```

</CH.Code>
</CH.Section>





### `unbond`

Unbond the delegations. Can be invoked by anyone after `ending_time` is reached.

<CH.Section>
<CH.Code>

```json json
{
    "unbond": {}
}
```

```rust msg.rs focus=1:2,4,6
#[cw_serde]
pub enum ExecuteMsg {
    Bond {},
    Unbond {},
    Refund {},
}
```

</CH.Code>
</CH.Section>



### `refund`

Donate all coins held by the contract to the community pool.

<CH.Section>
<CH.Code>

```json json
{
    "refund": {}
}
```

```rust msg.rs focus=1:2,5:6
#[cw_serde]
pub enum ExecuteMsg {
    Bond {},
    Unbond {},
    Refund {},
}
```

</CH.Code>
</CH.Section>

## SudoMsg

Forcibly unbond the delegations.

This "sudo" message can only be invoked by the gov module, and ignores whether the `ending_time` has been reached.

### `force_unbond`

<CH.Section>
<CH.Code>

```json json
{
    "force_unbond": {}
}
```

```rust msg.rs
#[cw_serde]
pub enum SudoMsg {
    ForceUnbond {},
}
```

</CH.Code>
</CH.Section>


## QueryMsg

### `config`

Return the contract configuration.

<CH.Section>
<CH.Code>

```json json
{
    "config": {}
}
```

```rust msg.rs
#[cw_serde]
#[derive(QueryResponses)]
pub enum QueryMsg {
    #[returns(Config)]
    Config {},
}
```

</CH.Code>
</CH.Section>

### Release v2.0.3

#### Common

- A bug was fixed where checkboxes weren't selectable or deselectable because a `for` and `id` value were missing on the label and input combination.

#### Credit Accounts
- HealthFactor above 1 always returns 1% Health now to prevent 0% liquidation warnings for HF > 1 accounts.
- When a user is not on the Trade page, a click-away handler was added to the `AccountDetails` component to close it when clicking outside of it to prevent buttons from being overlapped by the `AccountDetails` slide-out
- When lending a tiny amount (0.000001) of an asset, the amount reported by the `AccountQuery` could become 0. To prevent showing 0 values, fractions of the smallest amount possible are now prefixed with the less than sign `<`

- Testnets only show on the testnet outpost, while the mainnet app only shows mainnet outposts (incl. V1).
